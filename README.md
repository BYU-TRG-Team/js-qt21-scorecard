# Scorecard

An Express.js and React.js translation grading application that follows the [Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM)](https://themqm.org) convention.

## Installation

### Server Requirements

- PostgreSQL 9.x
- Node.js 16.x

### Setup NPM and a PostgreSQL instance

- NPM (Node Package Manager) will be needed for the installation of Scorecard. Please reference the [NPM documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for setup.
- A PostgreSQL instance will be needed for the Scorecard application. A database will also need to be created in the PostgreSQL instance. Please reference the [PostgreSQL downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for installers for various platforms.

### Third Party Requirements

**Scorecard requires a third party email provider to send emails**. The `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_PROVIDER`, and `EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY` environment variables exist for integration with a provider. 

Scorecard currently supports integration with **Zoho** and **SendGrid**. For Zoho, `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, and `EMAIL_PROVIDER` will need to be configured. For SendGrid, `EMAIL_ADDRESS`,`EMAIL_PROVIDER`, and `EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY` will need to be configured.

### Environment Variables

```
APP_ENV=<development | production>
DATABASE_URL=<url for the Scorecard database>
EMAIL_ADDRESS=<address from which emails will be sent>
EMAIL_PROVIDER=<Zoho | SendGrid>
EMAIL_PASSWORD=<password for hosted email account (used for Zoho only)>
EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY=<API key generated by email provider (used for SendGrid only)>
AUTH_SECRET=<64-bit CSPRNG secret>
```

### Build

```
npm ci
```


```
npm run build
```

### Database Configuration

**This step makes used of NPM packages installed from build.**

**NOTE: This script will destory and re-create all tables.**

```
DATABASE_URL=<url for the Scorecard database> node server/seed.js
```

### Launch 

```
npm run start
```

## Local Development

For local development, you will want to set the environment variable *APP_ENV*=*development*. To run the application locally, express and react can be run in parallel by running the following commands in different tabs:

```
npm run dev:server
```

```
npm run dev:react
```

The database will still need to be configured as mentioned in the installation section. Please refer to that section for details.

## MQM Scoring Model

The following formula is used within the express server to compute the OQS: 

_APT: absolute penality total_<br/>
_ONPT: overall normed penalty score_<br/>
_OQF: overall quality fraction_<br/>
_MSV: maximum score value, which is set to 100_<br/>
_OQS: overall quality score_<br/>
_sourceWordCount: total count of words in the source, where the text is parsed into words by using a **single whitespace as a delimiter**_<br/>
_targetWordCount: total count of words in the target, where the text is parsed into words by using a **single whitespace as a delimiter**_<br/>

**Severity Weights** 
- Netural: 0
- Minor: 1
- Major: 5
- Critical: 25

```
MSV = 100
APT = Total severity weights of all errors (both target and source)
ONPT = (APT * sourceWordCount) / targetWordCount
OQF = 1 - (ONPT / sourceWordCount)
OQS = (OQF * MSV)

```

NOTE: The final value of OQS is rounded to two decimals before being returned from the server.

## Project JSON Output 

The JSON output for a project is structured as defined below: 

```
{
    projectName: string,
    key: {
        [key: string]: string        
    }, // Map of segment IDs to segment numbers
    errors: {
        segment: string,
        target: string,
        name: string,
        severity: string,
        issueReportId: string,
        issueId: string,
        note: string,
        highlighting: {
            startIndex: number,
            endIndex: number
        }
    }[],
    metric: {
        parent: string | null,
        name: string,
        description: string,
        notes: string,
        examples: string,
        issueId: string
    }[],
    scores: {
        compositeScore: string
    },
    segments: {
        source: string[],
        target: string[],
    }
}

```

      "notes": "All errors specifically related to use of domain- or organization-specific terminology are included in this error and its children.\r\n\r\nDo not use this error if a text is simply mistranslated, i.e., if the translation would be a valid translation of the source but simply does not use the particular mandated terminology. For example, if a text translates [river] bank into Spanish as banco (a financial institution) instead of orilla (a river bank), this would be a mistranslation because banco would never be a valid term for the concept of a river bank. However, if a termbase specified that orilla should be used and the translation uses ribera instead, this would be a Terminology error because ribera is a valid term for the concept, but not the specified one.",
      "examples": "A French text translates English \"email\" as \"e-mail\" but terminology guidelines mandated that \"courriel\" be used.\n\nThe English musicological term dog is translated (literally) into German as Hund instead of as Schnarre, as specified in a terminology database.",

      "notes": "This error is used only to address inconsistent use of terminology in the target text. In cases where terminology is incorrect for the domain or termbase, wrong term or termbase should be used instead. If the inconsistent term use can be traced back to inconsist term use in the source text, the error type stays the same, but this special case should be annotated with an inconsistent source term root cause.",
      "examples": "A German source text uses one term for a component of a vehicle, but the target text uses “brake release lever”, “brake disengagement lever”, “manual brake release”, and “manual disengagement release” for this term in English.",
